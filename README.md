# Autism Spectrum Disorder Checking App

The Autism Spectrum Disorder Checking App is a powerful tool designed to assist in the early detection and assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This application leverages machine learning techniques and voice analysis to provide users with valuable insights.

## Features

- **Voice Analysis**: Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, the app analyzes voice recordings to detect potential indicators of ASD.
  
- **Age Detection**: Age information is collected to enhance the accuracy of the analysis, as certain traits may manifest differently depending on the individual's age.
  
- **Local Server Integration**: The app communicates with a local server running a neural network model, built using Flask API, for efficient processing of the input data.

- **Real-Time Results**: Users receive instant feedback on the analysis results, displayed directly within the app interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your local server computer.
3. Set up the Flask API on your local server by following the instructions provided in the `server/README.md` file.
4. Install the required dependencies for the app by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Launch the app and start using it to analyze voice recordings for potential indicators of ASD.
